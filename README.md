# Todo List Project

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), a comprehensive curriculum for learning web development.

## Introduction

This Todo List project is a fundamental web development exercise that focuses on building a dynamic application for managing tasks and projects. The project involves creating a user-friendly interface where users can organize their tasks, set priorities, and manage multiple projects.

## Assignment

- Implement a Todo List application where users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
- Organize tasks into projects to keep them separate and manageable.
- Each task should have properties such as title, description, due date, and priority.
- Separate application logic from DOM-related functionality by using modular programming techniques.
- Design the user interface to allow users to view all projects, view tasks within each project, expand tasks to see/edit details, and delete tasks.

## Features

- **Projects:** Users can create new projects and choose which project their tasks belong to.
- **Tasks:** Each task includes properties like title, description, due date, and priority.
- **User Interface:** The UI allows users to view, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks are visually organized based on priority and due date.
- **Persistence:** The application uses localStorage to save projects and tasks locally, ensuring data persistence even after page refreshes.
